## Resources

For this assignment, I used the following resources:

- lectures
- my notes
- your help via email
- and text messages between Lauren, Blakeley and myself

### Deductions

- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments

As expected, the functions that were required in this assignment proved the most difficult.

- I felt that the numba function expression was challenging to set up. I was confident in the if and else/if part of the code, but not the initial expression setup. Thank you for your pointers that helped me get back on track.

- The final favMovie function was quite difficult as well. It was difficult to determine what needed to be done after that first function to get the phrase to print out on the console. It required a lot of trial-and-error. Eventually, for this part of the assignment, Blakeley, Lauren and I chatted via text message about the issues we were having. With some very general tips from Lauren, I was able to add the second function and ultimately realized that I needed to add the additional parameter to that function.
